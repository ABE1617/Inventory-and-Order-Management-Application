# Inventory and Order Management Application – UML Design & OOP Architecture Development

## 🧠 Project Overview

A desktop-based application for managing an electronic components business(**Inventory and Order Management Application**), developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **C++**. The system is designed to handle end-to-end operations including inventory management, order processing, client and staff records, and sales analytics.

## 🚀 Features I Worked On: 

### ✅ Personnel Management
- Add, modify, delete, and view employee records.
- Automatic validation of duplicate entries.
- Search and manage based on name, role.

### ✅ Client Management
- Register and manage clients with full contact information.
- Modify client records and track their order history.
- Data integrity ensured through controlled access.

### ✅ Order Processing
- Create new customer orders with itemized product selection.
- Validate product availability before checkout.

### ✅ Inventory & Stock Control
- Manage a dynamic catalog of electronic components.
- Update stock levels based on incoming shipments or sales.
- Alert system for low-stock or out-of-stock items.

### ✅ Sales & Payment Management
- Calculate payment totals including taxes.
- Maintain transaction history for reporting.

### ✅ Analytics & Reporting
- Track sales performance over time.
- Identify top-selling products and most active clients.
- Generate operational summaries.

### ✅ DataBase Architecture and security
- Designed a structured, object-oriented data model (MCD, MPD, MLD).
- Ensured secure access and reliable storage for all business data.
